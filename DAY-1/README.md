# DevOps Fundamentals:
  
  **Definition:** 
  
    DevOps is a collaborative approach that combines development and operations teams, emphasizing communication, 
         collaboration, and automation throughout the software development and delivery process.

  **Key Concepts:**

# 1.Collaboration:
   
   Encourages effective communication between development and operations teams.Breaks down silos to create a shared responsibility for the entire software development lifecycle.

# 2.Automation:
    
   Automates repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors.CI/CD pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

# 3.Continuous Integration (CI):

   Integrates code changes frequently, ensuring early detection of issues.Typically involves automated testing to maintain code quality.

# 4.Continuous Deployment (CD):

   Automates the deployment process, allowing for rapid and reliable releases.Supports practices like Blue-Green deployments for minimal downtime.

# 5.Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

   Treats infrastructure provisioning as code.Enables versioning, replication, and consistency in infrastructure management.

**Example Scenario:**    Imagine a software development team working on a web application. Developers write code for new features and push 
     it to a version control system like Git. Here's how DevOps principles come into play:

# 1.Collaboration:

     Developers and operations discuss infrastructure requirements and deployment processes.They agree on a standard 
        procedure for handling different environments (development, testing, production).

# 2.Automation:

     A CI/CD pipeline is set up using tools like Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline.Code changes trigger automated builds, 
        tests, and deployments, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.

# 3.Continuous Integration (CI):

    Developers push code changes to the shared repository multiple times a day.Automated tests run with each 
       integration to catch issues early.

# 4.Continuous Deployment (CD):

    Once code passes automated tests, it automatically deploys to a staging environment for further testing.Successful 
       staging tests trigger automatic deployment to production.

# 5.Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

    Infrastructure is defined in code using tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.Changes to infrastructure are
      version-controlled and applied consistently across environments.
